# AstroYeet
Race through a dense asteroid field to escape your pursuers with their top secret research data.

AstroYeet is a top-down vertical endless runner with a twist. You have to evade asteroids while getting shot at from behind. If you go too slow, your pursuers will close in on you and become more accurate. Go too fast and you'll crash your ship into asteroids.
