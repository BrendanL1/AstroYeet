# AstroYeet
Race through a dense asteroid field to escape your pursuers with their top secret research data.

You have to evade asteroids while getting shot at in this high-speed chase. If you go too slow, your pursuers will close in on you and become more accurate. Go too fast and you'll crash into asteroids.
